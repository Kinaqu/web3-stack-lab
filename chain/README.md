# Chain

Chain deployment artifacts and OP Stack configuration outputs.

This folder contains:
- OP Stack deployer outputs
- L1 contracts deployment state
- L2 genesis/rollup config for spinning up a local devnet

## Key artifacts

Generated by OP Stack deployment tooling:
- **`genesis.json`** — L2 genesis for op-geth
- **`rollup.json`** — rollup config for op-node
- **`state.json`** — deployment state (L1 addresses, roles, startBlock, etc.)

## What `state.json` is used for

`state.json` is the source of truth for:
- `OptimismPortalProxy` (for L1→L2 deposits)
- `SystemConfigProxy`, bridges, dispute game contracts, etc.
- chain IDs and L1 start block used by the rollup node

In infra, you may extract a subset into `infra/l2-node/l1_contracts.json` for convenience.

## Notes on version compatibility

`rollup.json` may include fields that require newer op-node versions.
If `op-node` crashes with unknown field ... (e.g. `minBaseFee`), upgrade `op-node`/`op-geth` to a matching recent pair.
